# Project Onboarding Discovery: Analyze Existing Project

**Goal:** Analyze the existing SpreadPilot project based on specified files (`project_journal/`, `README.md`, `docs/01-system-architecture.md`) to produce a Stack Profile (`.ruru/context/stack_profile.json`) and a Requirements Document (`.ruru/docs/requirements.md`).

**Initial Request:** 'Use existing project files (project_journal/, README.md, docs/01-system-architecture.md) to analyze current status, update onboarding, and plan next steps.'

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [✅] Stack Profile (`.ruru/context/stack_profile.json`) is created and populated based on project analysis.
*   [✅] Requirements Document (`.ruru/docs/requirements.md`) is created in TOML+MD format, outlining derived requirements.
*   [✅] Analysis considers `README.md`, `docs/01-system-architecture.md`, and relevant `project_journal/` entries.

## Checklist

*   [✅] Initialize task log file (this file).
*   [✅] Read `README.md`.
*   [✅] Read `docs/01-system-architecture.md`.
*   [✅] Analyze project structure from `environment_details`.
*   [✅] (Optional) Read relevant files from `project_journal/` if needed for deeper context. (`project_journal/decisions/20250418-spreadpilot-architecture-reflections.md` read).
*   [✅] Synthesize and write `.ruru/context/stack_profile.json`.
*   [✅] Synthesize and write `.ruru/docs/requirements.md`.
*   [✅] Update task log with completion status and artifact paths.

## Logs

*   **2025-04-28 23:31:30 UTC:** Task initiated by `TASK-ONBOARD-20250428-232946`. Starting analysis.
*   **2025-04-28 23:34:00 UTC:** Analysis complete. Generated artifacts:
    *   Stack Profile: `.ruru/context/stack_profile.json`
    *   Requirements Doc: `.ruru/docs/requirements.md`

## Notes

*   This task focuses on extracting information from existing artifacts.
