# Task Log: Project Onboarding - SpreadPilot (Existing)

**Goal:** Perform stack detection (if needed), analyze the provided files/directories (`project_journal/`, `README.md`, `docs/01-system-architecture.md`) and general project context, ensure journal structure exists, and report completion.

**Initial User Request:** "Use existing project files (project_journal/, README.md, docs/01-system-architecture.md) to analyze current status, update onboarding, and plan next steps."

**Coordinator Task ID:** `TASK-CMD-20250428-232946`

## Log Entries
