# Coordinate Backend Refactoring for MongoDB Integration

## Description ✍️

*   **What is this feature?** Coordinate the necessary changes across backend services (starting with `admin-api`) to replace existing data persistence logic (likely Firestore, see `admin-api/app/db/firestore.py`) with MongoDB. Utilize the newly available Dockerized MongoDB instance (`mongodb` service in `docker-compose.yml`).
*   **Why is it needed?** To implement the architectural decision documented in ADR-20250429-MONGO, moving away from potential vendor lock-in and enabling flexible database deployment.
*   **Scope:** Oversee the refactoring of data access layers, configuration updates, dependency management, and initial testing for MongoDB integration in backend services. Ensure the implementation is adaptable for future connections to external MongoDB clusters via configuration.
*   **Links:**
    *   ADR: `.ruru/decisions/20250429-adopt-mongodb-primary-database.md`
    *   Completed Docker Task: `TASK-COMPOSE-20250429-003840`

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [✅] Backend Lead coordinates the delegation of specific refactoring tasks to relevant specialists (e.g., `data-mongo`, `dev-python`, `framework-fastapi`). (Delegated `TASK-MONGO-20250429-004500` to `data-mongo`)
*   - [✅] Data access layer in `admin-api` (FollowerService) is refactored to use an appropriate MongoDB client library (`motor`). (Completed via `TASK-MONGO-20250429-004500`)
*   - [✅] Configuration (e.g., `admin-api/app/core/config.py`) is updated to read MongoDB connection details (URI, DB name, credentials) from environment variables. (Completed by `lead-backend`)
*   - [ ] Existing Firestore code (`admin-api/app/db/firestore.py`) is removed or clearly marked as deprecated.
*   - [✅] Required MongoDB client libraries are added to relevant requirements files (e.g., `admin-api/requirements.in`) and installed. (Completed by `lead-backend`)
*   - [✅] Basic CRUD operations for key models (Followers in `admin-api`) function correctly against the MongoDB database running in Docker. (Verified by `data-mongo` in `TASK-MONGO-20250429-004500`)
*   - [✅] Relevant integration tests (e.g., in `tests/integration/`) are updated or created to verify MongoDB interactions, potentially requiring adjustments to test fixtures (`conftest.py`). (Completed via `TASK-TEST-20250429-005100`)

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   Prioritize refactoring the `admin-api` service first.
*   Analyze `admin-api` (FastAPI) to determine if an asynchronous driver like `motor` is more appropriate than synchronous `pymongo`.
*   [DONE] Delegate specific coding tasks (e.g., creating DB connection logic, refactoring service layers, updating models/schemas) to specialists like `data-mongo` or `dev-python`. (`TASK-MONGO-20250429-004500` completed)
*   [DONE] Ensure the connection logic handles both the Docker service name (`mongodb`) and potentially full external URIs based on environment variables. (Handled in `mongodb.py` and `config.py`)
*   [DONE] Coordinate with `lead-qa` or testing specialist for testing strategy updates and implementation. (`TASK-TEST-20250429-005100` completed)
*   [DONE] Remove Firestore code and dependencies. (Completed by `lead-backend`)
*   [DONE] Address background task dependency injection in `main.py`. (Completed by `lead-backend`)
