## Overview / Purpose 🎯

*   Initiate the onboarding process for the EXISTING project in directory '/home/alessio/NeuralTrading/SpreadPilot'.
*   Goal: Perform stack detection, gather context/requirements outline, ensure journal structure exists, and report completion to the coordinator.
*   Follow standard workflow: `.ruru/modes/manager-onboarding/kb/02-workflow-adaptive.md`.
