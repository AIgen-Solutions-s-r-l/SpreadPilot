   - Added `AssignmentState` from position.py
   - Added `TradeSide` and `TradeStatus` from trade.py

2. Added missing `AlertEvent` class to alert.py:
   - Created the class with required fields for the alert router

3. Fixed configuration issues:
   - Added default value for `GCP_PROJECT_ID` in alert_router/app/config.py

4. Created missing files:
   - Created admin-api/app/main.py with FastAPI setup

5. Added missing functions:
   - Added `calculate_daily_pnl` alias in report_worker/app/service/pnl.py
   - Added `generate_monthly_report` function to report_worker/app/service/generator.py
