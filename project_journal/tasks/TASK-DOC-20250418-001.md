# Task Log: TASK-DOC-20250418-001 - Documentation Update for Folder Structure Consolidation

**Goal:** Update all project documentation to reflect the folder structure consolidation from dual naming conventions (hyphenated and underscore) to only hyphenated directories.

## Context

The SpreadPilot project has consolidated its folder structure by:
1. Keeping only the hyphenated versions (`trading-bot`, `admin-api`, etc.)
2. Making the hyphenated directories importable as Python packages by adding `__init__.py` files
3. Updating import statements in tests and service files to use `importlib.import_module()`
4. Removing the underscore versions (`trading_bot`, `admin_api`, etc.)

## Actions Planned

1. **Update README.md**:
   - Add a note about the folder structure convention
   - Explain how to import from hyphenated directories

2. **Update Development Guide**:
   - Revise the "Repository Structure" section
   - Add a section on importing from hyphenated directories
   - Update code examples to use the correct import pattern

3. **Update System Architecture Documentation**:
   - Revise diagrams to show the simplified folder structure
   - Update any references to underscore directories

4. **Update API Documentation**:
   - Update import paths in examples
   - Ensure all references use the hyphenated directory names

5. **Update Code Comments**:
   - Ensure import examples in docstrings use the correct paths

## Progress

- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Update Development Guide
- [x] Update System Architecture Documentation
- [x] Update API Documentation
- [x] Update Code Comments
- [x] Final review and verification

## Summary of Changes

1. **README.md**:
   - Added a section about the folder structure convention
   - Explained how to import from hyphenated directories using `importlib.import_module()`

2. **docs/03-development-guide.md**:
   - Added a section about the folder naming convention
   - Added details on importing from hyphenated directories
   - Updated the "Running Individual Services" section with a note about imports
   - Added a "Test Import Patterns" section
   - Added a section about creating a new service with the correct folder structure

3. **docs/01-system-architecture.md**:
   - Added a "Code Organization" section that explains the folder structure convention

4. **docs/README.md**:
   - Added a section about the folder structure convention

5. **trading-bot/README.md**:
   - Added an "Import Pattern" section explaining how to import from the trading-bot directory

## Conclusion

All documentation has been updated to reflect the folder structure consolidation. The documentation now clearly explains:

- That only hyphenated versions of directories are now used
- How to properly import from hyphenated directories in Python using `importlib.import_module()`
- The location of `__init__.py` files that enable importing
- The rationale for this change (maintenance simplification, elimination of duplication)

These updates ensure that all developers will understand the new folder structure convention and how to work with it effectively.
