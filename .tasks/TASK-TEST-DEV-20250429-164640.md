# Enhance and Verify Integration Tests (MongoDB & Coverage)

**Objective:** Review the existing integration tests and the requirements outlined in `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md`. Implement the necessary enhancements, focusing on MongoDB integration (via Docker Compose), admin API coverage, and documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Integration tests can be successfully run using the MongoDB instance provided via Docker Compose.
*   Test coverage for the admin API (`admin_api/`) is enhanced as specified in the related task or deemed appropriate after review.
*   The testing process, including Docker Compose setup and execution, is clearly documented.

**Checklist:**

*   `[✅]` Review `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md` and existing integration tests in `tests/integration/`. (Task file reviewed, tests reviewed)
*   `[✅]` Verify the MongoDB service configuration in `docker-compose.yml` is suitable for testing. Ensure dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt`) include `motor` or similar async MongoDB driver. (docker-compose.yml verified, requirements verified)
*   `[✅]` Review relevant integration tests (e.g., `tests/integration/test_admin_api.py`, `tests/integration/conftest.py`) to ensure they correctly connect to and run against the MongoDB service defined in Docker Compose. (conftest.py reviewed, test_admin_api.py reviewed)
*   `[✅]` Analyze current admin API test coverage and identify areas for enhancement based on `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md` or code review. (Tests analyzed, several issues identified)
*   `[🚧]` Implement additional integration tests for the admin API to improve coverage. (Some tests implemented, but several are failing)
*   `[✅]` Update docker-compose.yml to remove dependencies on Firestore service. (All services updated to use MongoDB instead of Firestore)
*   `[✅]` Document the setup steps (running `docker-compose up`, required environment variables if any) and execution commands for running integration tests with MongoDB. Update or create `tests/integration/README.md` as appropriate. (README.md updated with MongoDB instructions)
*   `[🚧]` Fix failing tests in test_admin_api.py:
    *   `[ ]` Fix WebSocket tests (test_websocket_dashboard_connect, test_websocket_dashboard_multiple_clients, test_websocket_dashboard_disconnection_handling)
    *   `[✅]` Add missing FollowerUpdate class to admin_api/app/schemas/follower.py (Note: Class already existed)
    *   `[✅]` Fix dashboard API endpoint tests (test_dashboard_api_endpoints, test_dashboard_api_error_handling) (Note: Tests were already passing)
    *   `[✅]` Fix follower service tests (test_follower_service_additional_methods, test_follower_service_batch_operations, test_follower_service_trading_operations)
*   `[🚧]` Verify all relevant integration tests pass successfully when run against the MongoDB instance (using `docker-compose up` and `pytest`). (Some tests passing, others need fixes)
