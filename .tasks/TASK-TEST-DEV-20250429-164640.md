# Enhance and Verify Integration Tests (MongoDB & Coverage)

**Objective:** Review the existing integration tests and the requirements outlined in `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md`. Implement the necessary enhancements, focusing on MongoDB integration (via Docker Compose), admin API coverage, and documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Integration tests can be successfully run using the MongoDB instance provided via Docker Compose.
*   Test coverage for the admin API (`admin_api/`) is enhanced as specified in the related task or deemed appropriate after review.
*   The testing process, including Docker Compose setup and execution, is clearly documented.

**Checklist:**

*   `[ ]` Review `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md` and existing integration tests in `tests/integration/`.
*   `[ ]` Verify the MongoDB service configuration in `docker-compose.yml` is suitable for testing. Ensure dependencies (`requirements-dev.txt`) include `motor` or similar async MongoDB driver.
*   `[ ]` Review relevant integration tests (e.g., `tests/integration/test_admin_api.py`, `tests/integration/conftest.py`) to ensure they correctly connect to and run against the MongoDB service defined in Docker Compose.
*   `[ ]` Analyze current admin API test coverage and identify areas for enhancement based on `TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md` or code review.
*   `[ ]` Implement additional integration tests for the admin API to improve coverage.
*   `[ ]` Verify all relevant integration tests pass successfully when run against the MongoDB instance (using `docker-compose up` and `pytest`).
*   `[ ]` Document the setup steps (running `docker-compose up`, required environment variables if any) and execution commands for running integration tests with MongoDB. Update or create `tests/integration/README.md` as appropriate.
