# Analyze Project Documentation & Plan/Delegate Next Steps

**Objective:** Analyze project documentation (`project_journal/`, `README.md`, `docs/`) to identify unimplemented features or tasks, then plan and delegate their implementation.

**Log:**

*   **2025-04-29 16:42:31:** Task initiated based on user request. Delegating analysis to `agent-context-resolver`.
*   **2025-04-29 16:45:29:** Received analysis results from `agent-context-resolver`.
*   **2025-04-29 16:46:21:** User requested planning and delegation of identified tasks. Starting planning phase.
*   **2025-04-29 16:47:23:** Created MDTM task `.tasks/TASK-TEST-DEV-20250429-164640.md` for integration test enhancements. Delegating to `test-developer`.

**Analysis Summary (Identified Tasks):**

Based on the analysis of `README.md`, `project_journal/`, and `docs/`, the following potential unimplemented or incomplete tasks/features were identified:

1.  **Integration Test Verification & Enhancement:** Requires running tests with the Firestore emulator, enhancing admin API test coverage, and documenting the testing process (`TASK-TEST-20250418-001.md`). **Delegated via TASK-TEST-DEV-20250429-164640.**
2.  **Watchdog Restart Logic Refinement:** The service restart logic needs implementation specific to the deployment environment (`TASK-WATCHDOG-IMPL.md`).
3.  **Report Worker Testing:** Unit/integration tests for the report worker service are noted as needed (`TASK-REPORT-WORKER-IMPL.md`).
4.  **Frontend Dashboard Task Status:** The task log for the frontend implementation lacks a completion status (`TASK-FRONTEND-DASHBOARD-IMPL.md`).
5.  **Potential Future Enhancements:** Architecture reflections mention potential future work like Service Mesh, Advanced Monitoring, Chaos Engineering, etc. (`20250418-spreadpilot-architecture-reflections.md`).
