# Coordination Log: Initial User Interaction

- **2025-04-29 09:51:04:** Received initial user message "hi".
- **2025-04-29 09:51:04:** Attempted to present standard initial options via `ask_followup_question` as per Rule `02`.
- **2025-04-29 09:51:04:** **ERROR:** `ask_followup_question` failed with "Error: Current ask promise was ignored".
- **2025-04-29 09:51:04:** **Action:** Retrying the `ask_followup_question` with the standard initial prompt.
- **2025-04-29 09:51:50:** User selected goal: "execute tests and fix non passing one, you can run docker for databases if needed".
- **2025-04-29 09:51:50:** **Analysis:** This aligns with Option 6/11. The `test-developer` mode is best suited for running tests and fixing failures. Docker requirements will be handled as needed, potentially by `test-developer` or `infra-compose`.
- **2025-04-29 09:51:50:** **Action:** Proposing delegation to `test-developer` as per Rule `02`, Path B.
- **2025-04-29 09:52:59:** User confirmed delegation to `test-developer`.
- **2025-04-29 09:52:59:** **Decision:** Using MDTM workflow due to multi-step nature (run, analyze, fix) and potential environment setup (Docker). Rule `04-mdtm-workflow-initiation.md`.
- **2025-04-29 09:53:12:** **Action:** Created MDTM task file `.tasks/TASK-TEST-20250429-095312.md`.
- **2025-04-29 09:53:40:** **Action:** Delegating task to `test-developer` via `new_task`, referencing the MDTM file.
- **2025-04-29 12:18:00:** **Completion:** `test-developer` completed task `TASK-TEST-20250429-095312`. All tests passed after fixes. Task file marked as "🟢 Done". (Note: Git reported no changes to commit).
